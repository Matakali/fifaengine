# fifaengine
A basic FIFA 18 autobuyer based on oczkers fut-api.

To use, follow installation guide on https://github.com/futapi/fut

BE CAREFULL!!!
This is in BETA!

Verion 0.9 uploaded and almost working!
Few changes to do to get to v1.0!
I am almost there!

The .ui file contains the code for the GUI of the app.
To convert the .ui to .py use the .bat file. ( pyuic5 must be installed )

To make the .py a .exe file you have to have pyisntaller installed.

I need accounts to test this script/program on to make sure it's stable!
Please contact me if you would like to help!
